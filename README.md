# Test Search Layer Branch

This is a test branch to test the search layer kernel speed. The main.cu file calculates the run time of different optimizations. You can refer to the `master` branch for the instructions on how to run the code. 

You can also mess around with `test_n_query` (line 65) and `test_k` (line 70) parameter ranges to see how the kernels behaves with different input sizes.
